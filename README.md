<i>In development</i>

## A data processing module for Premier League football data &amp; beyond...

The original idea behind this was to build a version of the betting system documented here:

But it will also just be a generalised module providing a simple API for interacting with football results & betting data, to aid in analysing team performance and betting market data, and building predictive models.
